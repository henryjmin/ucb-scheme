Scheme/STk Widget Tour 0.2
--------------------------

This is a rewrite of the Tcl/Tk wtour2.0 in Scheme/STk. I wrote it
while I was learning the nuances of STk. I also avoided using the send
mechanisms to make it quicker/easier to learn (I had to set up all the
authentication stuff to have the Tcl/Tk wtour working).

Installing and Running
----------------------

To start the tour assume that the locations of the STk binary and library
in "stk-wtour" are correct. Once this is done, just type 
	% ./stk-wtour

Use the menus to navigate through different lessons.  You can make changes
to the lesson source code; click on the Apply button to see the results of
the changes.
 
Acknowledgements and Notes
--------------------------
The original,excellent, tour of Tcl/Tk was due to Andrew Payne
(payne@crl.dec.com). I hope you enjoy the Scheme version
(Adding some STklos lessons is next in the set of things to do).
I've tested it on Silicon Graphics running IRIX 5.2 (They are
the coolest machines around, look them up).
