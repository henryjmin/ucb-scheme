[Image] Demo directory





Content

     This directory contains the demo programs for STk. There are several
     categories of demos available from here:
        o STk demos: They correspond to program which don't use CLOS like
          object extension of STk. These demo are quite simple and they
          often mimic original Tcl/Tk demonstrations
        o STklos demos: These demonstration programs use the STklos object
          Extension of STk. The code of most of these demos has been kept
          short to illustrate the basic of STklos programming.
        o Html demo: This demo is in fact an overview of STk/STklos that I
          have used once in a presentation of STklos. The pages accessible
          from this link present STk but also contains links or Scheme
          applets which illustrate the kind of things that can be done with
          the STk browser. Of course, to properly execute the applets
          contained in theses pages, you need to run the STk Html browser
          (see below).

Running demonstration programs without installing STk

     If you want to run a demo BEFORE a complete installation of the STk
     package, you must use the shell script ../Src/test-stk in order to run
     the interpreter (this shell script set some variables to run properly
     the interpreter without installing it).

Running demonstration programs in the STk web browser

     STk provides a simple Web browser which can be used to launch the demo
     of this directory. If you are not running it now, you can type the
     following command:

               ../Src/test-stk -f S-scape README.html

     at the shell prompt.

1. STk demos

1.1 Basic STk demos

   * hello.stk
     This is the traditional first program. This program creates a single
     button that you can click on.
     Run with : ../Src/test-stk -f hello.stk

   * browse.stk
     A simple Unix file browser. The code of this demo is less than a page.
     Run with: .../Src/test-stk -f browse.stk

1.2 Basics of STk programming

   * wtour.stk
     This is a rewrite of the Tcl/Tk wtour2.0 in Scheme/STk. Use the menus
     to navigate through different lessons. You can make changes to the
     lesson source code; click on the Apply button to see the results of the
     changes.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f ./wtour.stk ../Contrib/STk-wtour
     Comment: This code is a contribution of Suresh Srinivas
     <ssriniva@cs.indiana.edu>

1.3 Client/Server Demos

   * server.stk
     A simple server showing how to use the socket package. It creates an
     xterm window in which a read-eval-print-loop is executed. When the
     window is closed or when an error occurs, the socket is closed
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -no -f server.stk

   * mc-server.stk
     A multiple-clients server. On Unix, you can use several telnet sessions
     to discuss with the server. Each discussion has its own dedicated
     channel. Type (exit) at the STk when you want to exit the demo.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -load mc-server.stk

1.4 Fun and Games

   * turtle.stk
     A Logo turtle package + some demo functions.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f turtle.stk

   * hanoi.stk
     Hanoi towers animation.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f hanoi.stk

   * queens.stk
     The queens problem. You can do it yourself (and it will make sure you
     follow the rules) or you can ask it to solve the puzzle starting with a
     given board configuration.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f queens.stk
     Comment: This code is a contribution of Grant Edwards
     <grante@rosemount.com)>

   * stetris.stk
     This is a falling block game not unlike tetris(tm) :). It is
     implemented in STk just to prove it can be done, and as a challenge to
     TCLers. It starts slowly and becomes faster and faster. Have fun.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f stetris.stk
     Comment: This code is a contribution of Harvey J. Stein
     <hjstein@math.huji.ac.il>

   * ttt.stk
     A 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, where the board is 4x4x4, a 3 dimensional board of
     four planes with four rows and four columns each.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f ttt.stk
     Comment: This code is a contribution of Edin "Dino" Hodzic
     <ehodzic@scu.edu>

1.5 Misc

   * console-demo.stk
     This is a simple demo showing a repl loop in a console.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f console.stk
     Comment: This demo is useful for Unix users only, since under Win32 STk
     is started with such a console.

   * colormap.stk
     This is a simple color palette written in STk.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f colormap.stk
     Comment: Note that this program is no more really useful since STk
     offers now the function Tk:choose-color which allow to choose a color
     by name or by value.

   * stkfontsel.stk
     This is a simple program which uses the STk font chooser.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f stkfontsel.stk

   * small-ed.stk
     A small editor to create enhanced text
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f small-ed.stk
     Comment: This editor use a ad-hoc format for saving file and was used
     for the help buttons of various widgets in old versions of STk. It will
     not be developed anymore since the preferred format for help is now
     HTML.

   * showvars.stk
     A variable shower: this program shows the value of three variables
     (named a,b and c) Changing the value of one of these vars (with a set!
     for instance) will redisplay its new value immediately. Run with:
     ../Src/test-stk -load showvars.stk

   * inspector.stk
     A simple demo of the inspector on Tk widgets
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f inspector.stk
     Comment: Does not work with this version of STk
     A new version of the inspector is in practically finished and will be
     soon released.

   * term.stk
     A simple terminal emulator (a kind of xterm, but in a text widget).
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f term.stk
     Comment: Users of Glibc2 (aka libc6, or RedHat 5.0 users): This program
     has problems with new release of the libc under Linux, if your shell
     has the line editing mode set. To avoid the problem you can
        o disable the line editing mode of your shell
        o set the SHELL variable to a dumb shell (e.g. ash)
        o link STk with the old libc
        o don't run the demo :-)

2. STklos demos

     All the standard Tk widgets have been wrapped in STklos classes. As a
     result, in STklos, Tk widgets are seen as instances of STklos classes.
     There are two kinds of STklos widgets:
        o Simple widgets which map one to one the Tk standard widgets
        o Composite widgets which are built from simple Tk widgets (or even
          simpler composite widgets).
     Demonstration programs accessible from this page use indifferently
     simple widgets and composite widgets.

2.1 Basic STklos demos

   * hello.stklos
     This is a simple rewriting of the hello.stk demonstration in STklos
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f hello.stklos

   * browse.stklos
     This is a simple rewriting of the browse.stk demonstration in STklos
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f browse.stklos

   * stklos-demo.stklos A simple demo written in STklos.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f stklos-demo.stklos
     Comment: What is interesting in this demo is not what it does, nothing
     specially fancy, but how it is easy to program, IMHO.

   * stklos-demo2.stklos Another simple demo written in STklos.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f stklos-demo2.stklos
     Comment: Here again, what is interesting in this demo is not what it
     does, nothing specially fancy, but how it is easy to program, IMHO.

   * classbrowse.stklos This demo shows the STklos class browser.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f classbrowse.stklos

2.2 STklos widgets

   * widget.stklos
     A tour of the Tk widgets. This demo shows all the Tk widgets. This is a
     rewriting in STklos of the big Tcl/Tk demo widget.tcl. For each widget
     demo accessible from this program, you can see the source by just
     clicking the "See code" button. You can modify the code and test your
     modified version by clicking the button "Rerun demo"
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f widget.stk
     Comment: This demo illustrate only the simple widgets (the ones of the
     Tk library). For a composite widgets demo look at the
     stklos-widgets.stklos program.

   * filebox.stklos
     This is a simple program which uses the <File-box> composite widget. A
     <File-box> is a file requester with file name completion (on the Tab
     key).This widget is itself a composition of various composite widget
     classes.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f filebox.stklos

   * stklos-widgets.stklos
     A quick demo of some of the STklos Composite widgets which are
     available in this release.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f stklos-widgets.stklos
     Comment: This code is a contribution of Drew Whitehouse
     <Drew.Whitehouse@anu.edu.au>.

2.3 STklos Applications

   * calc.stklos
     This is a simplistic calculator.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f calc.stklos

   * tkcolor.stklos
     This is a simple color picker written in STklos. Clicking the left
     mouse button in the color box sets the text color to the chosen color.
     Clicking the right button sets the background color. The Select button
     sets the selection to a string which can be used (by pasting it in an
     xterm window) as argument of most X11 applications to set their
     foreground and background color.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f tkcolor.stklos

   * amib.stklos
     A Mini Interface Builder.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f amib.stklos
     Comment: The current version of AMIB allow you to:
        o place objects on a plane by drag and drop
        o resize objects
        o displace objects
        o change all the slots of an object (color, font, value, ...)
        o save an interface to reload it later in an application
     However it is far from a really usable interface builder (but after all
     it is only a 600 lines of code application!!!!)

   * S-scape.stklos
     The STk web browser. You are probably using it while seeing these
     lines.
     Run with: ../Src/test-stk -f S-scape.stklos
